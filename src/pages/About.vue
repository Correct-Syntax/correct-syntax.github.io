        <h1 class="heading">About Me</h1>
        <p class="text">I'm a designer and developer creating websites, desktop software and unique libraries. Currently I'm working on my startup, <a class="link" href="https://www.correctsyntax.com" target="blank">Correct Syntax Web Design</a> to serve clients in Ava, Missouri and beyond.</p>
        <p class="text">I also lead the development of the open source non-destructive (node-based) image editor called <a class="link" href="https://gimelstudio.github.io">Gimel Studio</a>.</p>
        <p class="text">I've been blessed to work on many different design &amp; software projects, from e-commerce sites to developing desktop software. Writing code and designing interfaces for both the desktop &amp; web is something I enjoy.</p>

      <p class="text">I am open for constructive and edifying feedback from others, whether it be about an article I wrote, my conduct, or how I could improve my design/development skills. In design and programming I learn new things all the time, constantly improving my skills and experimenting with different frameworks, styles, design techniques, etc.</p>
      <p class="text">I am also continuing to learn to walk out our Heavenly Father, Yahweh's standard of love as a believer and am open to correction in my understandings of Scripture, from others.</p>
      <p class="text">When I am not coding or designing, you can usually find me volunteering, sketching nature, reading and studying or just strumming the guitar (among other things). :)</p>
      <p class="text">Feel free to contact me with questions or comments. Thank you!</p>
