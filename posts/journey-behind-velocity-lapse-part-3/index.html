Previously, it had only been available in 27 select countries because I wanted to make sure to iron out some issues and &ldquo;test the waters&rdquo; so-to-speak before opening up to the whole world.</p><h3 id=the-first-sales-of-velocity-lapse-pro>The first sales of Velocity Lapse PRO</h3><p>Roughly a week later, the very first Velocity Lapse PRO upgrade was purchased. Oct. 24th, 2022 to be exact. There were 321 total downloads and 131 active installs at that time.</p><p>Granted, it was only a few dollars after taxes and Google Play&rsquo;s cut, but it felt really good to have the first sale of the PRO upgrade after months of work with no ROI (besides some nice compliments).</p><p>In the following weeks, sales happened sporadically, mostly in bunches. There was a total of 8 upgrades in the first 3 weeks of being rolled out to all countries.</p><h3 id=creating-the-first-tutorial>Creating the first tutorial</h3><p>For a while, I had been considering making a tutorial on how to capture a starry night time lapse using Velocity Lapse on an Android phone.</p><p>Finally, I took advantage of a night at a campground where I could capture a timelapse of the stars without a lot of light pollution.</p><p>The timelapse itself turned out, but I made the mistake of not explaining what I was doing for the tutorial as I was setting up and capturing. Having to voice over the screencapture and time things correctly in the editing stage was a whole lot more work.</p><p>Although I have created videos before, this was actually my first video tutorial for YouTube that I voiced-over. Even though I felt that it wasn&rsquo;t the best, I was motivated to finish the tutorial because by just finishing it, I knew I would learn something.</p><p>As expected, the video didn&rsquo;t get a lot of reception. However, I did learn some important lessons by making the video which I can apply to future videos.</p><h3 id=amazon-app-store>Amazon app store</h3><p>I considered submitting to the Amazon appstore to gain more visibility and to see if I can&rsquo;t submit an app there, even just for the experience.</p><p>I created an Amazon developers account and began to go through the form to submit Velocity Lapse so that I could integrate amazon billing into the app. (App stores require you to upload the app bundle before you can create IAP to integrate them into your app).</p><p>However, after uploading the bundle I found out that due to Velocity Lapse needing the camera autofocus feature, only 3 (old) Amazon devices would be supported. And, at that I would have to lower the minimum SDK version to even get that support.</p><figure><img src=https://noahrahm.com/posts/journey-behind-velocity-lapse-3/amazon-appstore-app-support.jpg alt="A screenshot showing Amazon tablets support for Velocity Lapse"><figcaption><p>Amazon device support for Velocity Lapse</p></figcaption></figure><p>So, it just didn&rsquo;t seem worth it. At least, for now.</p><h3 id=social-media-marketing-update>Social media marketing update</h3><p>I finally posted on Instagram. I thought maybe the starscape time lapse video from the tutorial would be a good first post. Got some response.</p><p>The Youtube channel continued to grow with 40K views on the starry night sky video and a couple hundred views on other videos. I continued to post new time lapse videos roughly every 2 weeks and that caused the channel to gain more subscribers and views.</p><h3 id=product-hunt>Product hunt</h3><p>For quite a while now, I&rsquo;ve eyed <a href=https://producthunt.com>Product Hunt</a>. I setup the information for Velocity Lapse. However, I could do much more because at this point I didn&rsquo;t have a good idea of when I planned to launch.</p><h3 id=first-negative-reviews>First negative reviews</h3><p>Up until this point, there was 99% positive feedback. However, there was a period where a few users submitted 2 bad 1 star reviews through the Google Play testing feedback. Naturally I expected it, just didn&rsquo;t know when it would come.</p><p>It appeared that it was due to a bug where the app would crash if the export button was tapped multiple times. So, I had to de bounce the export button to fix the issue.</p><p>Or, so I thought.</p><p>Obviously, that was <em>an</em> issue, but it was not <em>the</em> issue as I continued to recieve feedback that the export didn&rsquo;t work on certain devices.</p><h3 id=crash-analytics>Crash analytics?</h3><p>Unfortunately, without crash analytics the only thing I had to reference was the Google Play crash reports. By default Google Play just shows that a crash happened, the device, and the exception name.</p><p>It made me consider that I may have to give in on my idea of &ldquo;staying away from adding any tracking whatsoever to Velocity Lapse&rdquo;. This was tough, because I really wanted to have no analytics, but without it, is is harder to debug problems users are having with the app.</p><p>In the end, I decided to hold off on adding analytics and see if I couldn&rsquo;t just figure out the issue myself.</p><h3 id=submitting-to-alternativetonet>Submitting to AlternativeTo.net</h3><p>I submitted Velocity Lapse to <a href=https://alternativeto.net>AlternativeTo.net</a>, a popular place to look for alternatives to software. In the past, when I&rsquo;ve posted other open source software projects I&rsquo;ve worked on there, a large portion of traffic came from there. So I thought I would try posting Velocity Lapse there for more exposure.</p><h3 id=updating-the-google-play-listing--website-yet-again>Updating the Google Play listing & website (yet again)</h3><p>Yet again, I updated the website and the Google Play listing to better match the style I came up with while creating promo images for Product Hunt.</p><h3 id=more-woes-of-the-camera2-api>More woes of the camera2 api</h3><p>I have respect for every app developer that deals with camera2 and indeed timelapse app devs. <em>sigh</em></p><p>One issue I had when previously implementing manual camera controls was with white balance. For some reason, manual white balance wouldn&rsquo;t switch back to auto unless ISO and shutter speed were also auto.</p><p>Thus, rather than releasing a feature that only partly worked, I just didn&rsquo;t include manual white balance control.</p><h3 id=when-to-make-the-big-release-into-production>When to make the big release into production?</h3><p>I needed to make the decision of when to fully release Velocity Lapse. It is tricky because you don&rsquo;t want to release it before it&rsquo;s ready, but you also don&rsquo;t want to overthink it.</p><p>My thought was to release it early Spring, as the majority of people will likely want to create time lapse videos in the Spring/Summer. So, my strategy was: get the app up to speed during the winter and release somewhere early Spring.</p><h3 id=app-marketing-strategies>App marketing strategies</h3><p>The balance between building a great product and marketing is difficult. On one side you want to make the product worthwhile and the best it can be but on the other hand, it&rsquo;s pointless unless someone knows about it. Perfecting the little details while neglected marketing is an easy thing to do.</p><h4 id=heading></h4><p>I mentioned this in the <a href=https://noahrahm.com/posts/journey-behind-velocity-lapse-part-1/>first post</a> of this series, but early on when I first started designing the app, I came across something profound.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfzxL9lXSdE">this video</a> about app marketing strategies, he explains a few points which I think are worth sharing here.</p><p>The first one is, of course: <strong>Make the app &lsquo;great&rsquo;. Because a &ldquo;just okay&rdquo; app is hard to market.</strong></p><p>In order for an app to be successful, it should be something you are proud of, something you (would) use everyday. It should be a legacy, your &ldquo;life&rsquo;s work&rdquo;, something you tell your grandchildren about.</p><p>Another words, the app really <em>is</em> great.</p><p>His second point was: <strong>Reach out to the leading experts (influencers) in your niche and get them to try your app.</strong></p><p>It made me think of the fact that if you don&rsquo;t even have the confidence to reach out to leading experts in the niche, your app may not be &lsquo;great&rsquo;. Though, you only have one chance to make a good first impression so you want to make sure you actually do have a &lsquo;great&rsquo; app.</p><p>The third point was to: <strong>Build around your core audience</strong>.</p><p>Getting in close contact with the people that use your app everyday and getting them involved in the building of the app.</p><p>I can really say that where I have put these points into practice so far, it has paid off.</p><h3 id=continued-development>Continued development</h3><p>As I winded down the v0.2.x and moved to the v0.3.x series of open testing releases, I planned the roadmap for the next series of releases, v0.3.x and v0.4.x.</p><h4 id=v03x-series>v0.3.x series</h4><p>v0.3.0 was an update I had been planning for a while. I planned to begin implementing the edit view features like importing external images <em>into</em> an existing project, and (of course) crush some bugs that had been reported.</p><p>I rewrote and improved the whole import system, added the ability to import images into an existing project. Thankfully, I was able to fixed some bugs including a long standing bug where images with uppercase file extensions would be ignored when importing.</p><h4 id=beginning-work-on-edit-preview>Beginning work on edit preview</h4><p>I then began working on the preview for the edit view. This required the preview to update quickly when an adjustment was made, so I quickly ruled out using a temporary physical file.</p><p>Due to my lack of experience with this side of Flutter, I went ahead and asked in the Flutter help channel about what the most optimized way of creating a real-time image preview was.</p><p>It was suggested that I look into the Flutter <code>Texture</code> widget as that would give me the low-level access to get the update speed I was looking for.</p><p><strong>EDIT: I ended up just leaving off working on this to work on higher priority issues and features</strong></p><h3 id=user-support>User Support</h3><p>One thing about selling software is the support aspect of it. From the very start, I made a real effort to respond to <em>every</em> person that submitted feedback on Velocity Lapse, whether good or bad. Many people responded that they appreciated the response which was encouraging.</p><p>However, I won&rsquo;t lie and say that it was easy to stay on top of it. I took the approach of &ldquo;better late than never&rdquo; when worst came to worst when I didn&rsquo;t get to responding for 2-3 weeks. :(</p><h3 id=ending-off-2022>Ending off 2022</h3><p>All in all, the first 5 months since I first had the idea for Velocity Lapse went well.</p><h4 id=app-statistics>App Statistics</h4><p>From a statistical point of view, the app had been growing at a constant rate, gaining anywhere from 10-80 users daily on average.</p><p>As of Dec. 31st 2022, there were 914 current installs and just shy of 4K total downloads.</p><p>In the first 3 months of having the PRO upgrade, the app averaged $35 per month gross. Which, isn&rsquo;t too terrible in my opinion, for an app that is still in early-access and hasn&rsquo;t been heavily promoted yet.</p><p>That said, if my main goal was to be making any sort of meaningful revenue from the app, thus far I would be disappointed.</p><h4 id=user-feedback>User feedback</h4><p>I received a good amount of positive feedback. It seemed that the negative feedback came as a result of app crashes, bugs, etc which is totally understandable. I was thankful for everyone that submitted feedback, whether positive or negative, as it helped to gauge the app progress, etc.</p><h4 id=personal-goals>Personal goals</h4><p>Thus far, Velocity Lapse is very much usable for creating time lapses. However, I still have a few personal feature needs that I believe need to be implemented. The camera and editor features, motion blur, and star trails are some big ones that I feel are missing. I hope that I can find the time to bring these features into the app in the coming months and years.</p><p>Overall, going from not knowing Flutter and not much about Android development, to having an app in beta bringing some ROI and good feedback, I feel that I have learned a lot. It most certainly has been a journey of overcoming challenges, both technical and physical.</p><h3 id=the-journey-continues>The journey continues</h3><p>Thanks for reading. I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed this post and have gained something from this journey so far.
