Wondering how this site is built? It's a very simple tech stack for this simple, minimalistic site.

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) - the static site generator used to, well.. generate the site.
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - used for the utility-first CSS approach, with bits of my own custom CSS added.
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) - used for the bits of javascript functionality on this site.
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - used to host this site.
- [Coollabs fonts](https://fonts.coollabs.io/) - used as a privacy-friendly replacement for Google Fonts.
