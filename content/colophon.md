**Wondering what goes into creating a website like this?** This page is for you.

### Tech

Here's the tech stack I used for this site:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) - used to generate the static website.
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - used for the utility-first CSS approach, with my own custom CSS added.
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) - used for the bits of Javascript functionality on this site.
- [Coollabs fonts](https://fonts.coollabs.io/) - used as a privacy-friendly replacement for Google Fonts.
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - used to host this site.
- [Matomo](https://matomo.org) - used for privacy-respecting analytics (self-hosted).

Source code for this website is available in the Github [repository](https://github.com/Correct-Syntax/correct-syntax.github.io).

### Visuals

I designed the pages in [Lunacy](https://icons8.com/lunacy) (I don't really care for the name) and created whatever other mockups and graphics were necessary myself using a combination of [Blender](https://blender.org), [GIMP](https://gimp.org), and [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/).
