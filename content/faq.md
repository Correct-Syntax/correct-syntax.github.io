#### Will you write the copy (content) for my website?

While I can provide resources and advice to help you create copy for your website, I don't offer copywriting services.


#### How much will my project cost?

Due to the variations in scope, complexity and other factors, the pricing of one website can be very different from another. Small projects can be priced based on my current base rate of $50/hr. Please [contact me](mailto:hi@noahrahm.com), and we can discuss pricing that works for your specific project and budget.


#### How long will it take to complete my website?

The time frame for completing a website depends on your specific project, scope, complexity, and your availability. That said, most end-to-end build projects I have worked on have taken anywhere from 1–8 months to complete.


#### What happens after the website launch?

Once the website is live, I'll give you the passwords and information you need to login and maintain the website.

I'm available up to 14 days after the website launch to ensure that everything is working smoothly and address any issues. I’m also happy to answer any questions you have as time permits. I'm here for you.


#### Can you create a website for me with Squarespace, Weebly, Wix, or Shopify?

I could, but I won't. By limiting my services to WordPress and Hugo-based static websites, I can provide you with expertise. For the majority of websites, either WordPress or Hugo can provide you with more than enough flexibility for your needs.


#### Do you handle SEO?

Search engine optimization generally involves on-page, off-page, and technical SEO.

When building your website, I handle **technical SEO** by ensuring your website is optimized to meet the technical requirements of search engines. However, I don't do on-page or off-site SEO as it is a long-term and ongoing process.


#### Will I be able to update my website after it goes live?

Yes, you will be able to update and make changes to your website yourself:

**WordPress websites** You can easily maintain your website after it’s live through the WordPress dashboard. Since I create websites using blocks, you can edit your content with the visual Block editor.

**Hugo-based static websites** You can edit your website's content using various visual editor frontends that support Hugo sites.


#### Can I pay you to update and maintain my website after it's live?

Yes, if you'd rather have me update and keep your website running smoothly, I offer a general website maintenance and update service for WordPress and static websites. This is billed at $40/hr with a minimum of 30 minutes.


#### How long have you been designing websites?

I've been designing websites since 2019. Professionally since 2022.


#### Are you available on weekends?

I'm not available on the weekends except for Sundays if agreed to in advance.

I take "Friday" afternoon and "Saturday" off in observance of the Biblical Sabbath day, so I don't answer emails or calls then.

If you need to get ahold of me during the weekend, please leave a message, and I'll get back to you on the next business day.


#### Where are you located?

I'm based in Missouri (USA), but I currently travel and work remotely. I work with clients in the USA and abroad and can accommodate for differences in time zones.
