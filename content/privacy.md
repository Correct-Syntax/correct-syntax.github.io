This website does not have analytics or social network buttons that track you. I donâ€™t collect any information about you. Pretty simple, but that means I never know that anyone actually visits my site unless they comment or get it touch...

This site uses third-party web fonts via [Coollabs fonts](https://fonts.coollabs.io/), a privacy-friendly replacement for Google Fonts. It also uses the [unpkg.com CDN](https://unpkg.com) to serve Alpine.js.
