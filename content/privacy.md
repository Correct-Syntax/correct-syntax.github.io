This website (noahrahm.com) uses [Matomo](https://matomo.org), a privacy-focused analytics platform. 

- It is self-hosted, which means that the data never leaves my server.
- The analytics are used soley for the purposes of audience measurement and evaluation of website performance.
- The analytics don't track you across the web. Because the data doesn't leave my server, Matomo (as a company) doesn't see that data either.

This site uses third-party web fonts via [Coollabs fonts](https://fonts.coollabs.io/), a privacy-friendly replacement for Google Fonts. It also uses the [unpkg.com CDN](https://unpkg.com) to serve Alpine.js.
