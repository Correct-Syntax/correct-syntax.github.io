description: Timothy needed a logo refresh for his IT service business. The goal was to keep the brand colors and general concept of the prior logo while creating a scalable, clean, and fresh design. The final logo is based on the idea of an abstract lightbulb with an “R” (for Revelation) and the Christian fish shape making up the filament.
