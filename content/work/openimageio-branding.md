description: Despite being incorporated into several commercial products and used extensively in animation and VFX studios all over the world, OpenImageIO didn't have a proper logo. I delivered a modern logo and brand guidelines in time for the project's transfer to the Academy Software Foundation.

When working on a logo design project, I begin with a research phase to learn about the industry and client. Looking through existing OpenImageIO materials, I found [an image of a pixel grid](https://openimageio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/grid-small.jpg) in the OpenImageIO documentation. It gave me the idea to experiment with variations of a simplified pixel grid. 

Since OpenImageIO is a library for reading, writing, and processing images, I brainstormed concepts having to do with pixels in an image, image processing, and file I/O. 

With feedback from Larry Gritz, OpenImageIO's maintainer, and others, I refined the concept to a square with a grid of pixels and a gradient, representing the processing of an image. The final consensus was the logo concept with a square icon and a wordmark set in Open Sans bold.

Once the logo concept was finalized, I created different color variations of the logo for potential use cases, and included guidelines for use in a brand guidelines book. I also created a few promotional graphics.

The OpenImageIO logo was a success, helping OpenImageIO meet the logo requirement for inclusion in the Academy Software Foundation's projects, and providing a proper representation of the 15-year-old project.
