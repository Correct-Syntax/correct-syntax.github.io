description: Despite being incorporated into several commercial products and used extensively in animation and VFX studios all over the world, OpenImageIO didn't have a proper logo. I created the logo and a brand guidelines book for the project.

Since OpenImageIO is a library for reading, writing, and processing images I brainstormed concepts having to do with pixels of an image.

Inspired by [this image](https://openimageio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/grid-small.jpg) from the OpenImageIO docs, I experimented with multiple variations of a pixel grid. The final consensus was a modern, square icon and workmark set in Open Sans bold.
