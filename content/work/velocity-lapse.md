Prior to working on Velocity Lapse, I typically only worked on web design and development projects. Velocity Lapse gave me the opportunity to lean into Android mobile app design and development, app marketing, and user support. 

The initial design and development began in the summer of 2022. In late 2022, Velocity Lapse became available as an early-access beta on Google Play, gaining over 22K users and a nomination for the Hackernoon Startup of the Year 2023.

I developed and refined Velocity Lapse based on feedback from beta users before finally launching v1.0 into production on November 17th, 2024.

Velocity Lapse uses mutiple hardware Android APIs like camera2 and MediaCodec, as well as the C++ NDK and OpenCV, making it one of the most hardware-intensive projects I've worked on to date.

I've written a few thousand words about the full process in a [series of posts](/posts/journey-behind-velocity-lapse-part-1/) if you'd like to get a dev-log style look at my journey creating and launching Velocity Lapse.
