I typically work on web design and development projects, so Velocity Lapse is a way for me to lean into mobile app design and development, app marketing, and user support. Creating Velocity Lapse combines my passion for photography with my design and development skills for the unique challenges in creating a mobile app. 

I've already written a few thousand words about the process in a [series of posts](/posts/journey-behind-velocity-lapse-part-1/) if you'd like to get a glimpse of my journey in creating the app.
