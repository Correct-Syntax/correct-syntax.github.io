description: Currently a semi-working prototype, Gimel Studio is a non-destructive, node-based 2D graphics editor, focused on simplicity, speed, elegance, and usability. Gimel Studio was one of my first open-source projects and remains the most popular. My role thus far has been design, development, and project management, with major contributions from @iwoithe (now a core team member), and 13 other contributors.
