*"In Flameshot, we were looking for a solution to have a website that can contain various essential aspects into one platform including documentation, FAQ, and also it portrays our software, Flameshot, as a beautiful and easy-to-use...tool. [Noah] kindly provided our open source project a website based on [the] Zola static website generator, with a beautiful design using modern front-end technologies. At the same time, this reduces the maintenance efforts from our dev team and improves the aesthetics and user-friendliness compared to our previous solution. [He] worked closely with us to tailor the website exactly to our needs. We wholeheartedly recommend [him]."*
