Hey there! 

I'm a freelance web designer/developer from the U.S, [serving clients](https://correctsyntax.com) with design, development, and tech support services.

I've been very blessed to work on a variety of different projects with a range of (really great) clients. I love doing meaningful work that helps people and glorifies Yahweh, our Heavenly Father. 

Creating things, collaborating with others, and learning new tech drives me to create and contribute to open-source software projects, most notably [Gimel Studio](https://gimelstudio.github.io) and [Bible Notify](https://biblenotify.github.io). 

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:hi@noahrahm.com) with any questions or comments you have. Thank you.
