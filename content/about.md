I help clients in the US and abroad create meaningful digital experiences and printed materials.

Based in the central United States, I provide custom design and development [services](/services/) for organizations, startups, and businesses.

I'm currently open to collaboration and new client work, so feel free to [get in touch](mailto:hi@noahrahm.com) to chat about your project, or just say hello.

#### Personal

I love working on meaningful [projects](/work/) that glorify our Heavenly Father Yahweh and have a positive impact on others. 

A few of my hobbies outside of work include: photography, drawing, music, and enjoying Yahweh's awesome creation (the great outdoors).


#### Other endeavors

I'm the creator, developer, and designer of [Velocity Lapse](https://velocitylapse.com), an Android app to create time lapses.

Creating things, collaborating with others, and learning new tech motivates me to create and contribute to open-source projects. Most notably: [Gimel Studio](https://gimelstudio.github.io), [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org), and [Bible Notify](https://biblenotify.github.io).
