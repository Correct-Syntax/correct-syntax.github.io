Based in the central United States, I provide visual design and development services for organizations, startups, and businesses. I especially love working on meaningful projects that glorify our Heavenly Father, Yahweh, and have a positive impact on others.

I’m currently open to new client work and collaboration opportunities, so feel free to get in [get in touch](mailto:hi@noahrahm.com).


#### Personal 

A few of my hobbies include photography, drawing, music, and enjoying Yahweh’s awesome creation with my family.


#### Other endeavors

I've been extremely blessed to work on a lot of different projects with many great people.

Since last year, I've been working on [Velocity Lapse](https://velocitylapse.com), an Android app to create time-lapses. I'm also a part of a project to film high-quality readings of the Psalms in nature called [The Psalms 23 Project](https://psalms23project.com).

Creating things, collaborating with others, and learning new technologies motivate me to create and contribute to open-source projects. Most notably [Gimel Studio](https://github.com/GimelStudio), [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org), and [Bible Notify](https://biblenotify.github.io).
