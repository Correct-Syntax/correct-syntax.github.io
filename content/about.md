I'm a [logo designer](/logos/) and software developer based in the Midwestern United States. I especially love working on meaningful projects that glorify our Heavenly Father Yahweh, and have a positive impact on others.

I’m currently open to new client work and collaboration opportunities, so feel free to [say hello](mailto:hi@noahrahm.com).


#### Personal 

A few of my hobbies include [drawing](https://art.noahrahm.com), [photography](https://art.noahrahm.com/photography/), music, [writing](https://blog.noahrahm.com), and enjoying Yahweh’s awesome creation with my family.


#### Other endeavors

I've been extremely blessed to work on a lot of different projects and collaborate with many great people.

Combining my passion for photography and filmmaking with my technical skills, since mid-2022, I've been working on [Velocity Lapse](https://velocitylapse.com), an Android app to create time-lapses. 

Creating things, collaborating with others, and learning new technologies motivate me to create and contribute to open-source projects, including [Gimel Studio](https://gimelstudio.com), [Bibleside](https://bibleside.com), and [Bible Notify](https://biblenotify.github.io).

I'm also a part of a project to film high-quality readings of the Psalms in nature, called [The Psalms 23 Project](https://psalms23project.com).
