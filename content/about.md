Hello! I'm Noah, a web designer and developer based in the U.S. 

I love doing meaningful work that glorifies Yahweh our Heavenly Father, and inspires and helps others. I've been blessed to work on a variety of [projects](/work/) from custom web applications to logo designs. I also develop an Android app to create time lapse videos, called [Velocity Lapse](https://velocitylapse.com).

Creating things, collaborating with others, and learning new technologies motivates me to create and contribute to open-source software projects, most notably [Gimel Studio](https://gimelstudio.github.io), [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org), and [Bible Notify](https://biblenotify.github.io). 

Some of my hobbies include photography, drawing, music, and enjoying the outdoors. 

I'm open to collaboration and new client work, so feel free to [get in touch](mailto:hi@noahrahm.com).
