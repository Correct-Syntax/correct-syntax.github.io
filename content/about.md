Hello, I'm a web designer and developer based in the U.S. 

I love doing meaningful work that inspires and helps people, and glorifies Yahweh our Heavenly Father.  I've been very blessed to work on a variety of [projects](/work/), and thankful to have worked with many great clients. 

In the past year, my interest in photography and videography has led me to embark on [a journey](/posts/journey-behind-velocity-lapse-part-1/) to develop a [mobile app](https://velocitylapse.com) for time lapse.

Creating things, collaborating with others, and learning new technologies motivates me to create and contribute to open-source software projects, most notably [Gimel Studio](https://gimelstudio.github.io), [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org), and [Bible Notify](https://biblenotify.github.io). 

I'm open to collaboration and new client work so feel free to [get in touch](mailto:hi@noahrahm.com).
