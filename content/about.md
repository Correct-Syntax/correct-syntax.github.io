Hey there! 

I'm a designer and developer creating websites, desktop software and libraries. I currently freelance web design and development, serving clients across the US.

I have been very blessed to work on a variety of different design & software projects, from e-commerce sites to developing an open-source, node-based software program called [Gimel Studio](https://gimelstudio.github.io).

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:hi@noahrahm.com) with any questions or comments you have. Thank you!
