If you say *Yes* to something now, it usually means saying *No* to something later. It doesn't matter whether it is making a purchase or adding a new task to your schedule.

Ultimately, what you say "Yes" or "No" to determines the course of your life. It's called making a decision.

Although some people may try to avoid it via debt or overworking, it is consistent: Unlike Yahweh our Heavenly Father, we are finite in our time and resources. Thus, we must make decisions. We must eventually say "No" to something and close the door in our lives, as hard as that can be sometimes.

In reality, we are constantly making decisions all the time. Unless we did, we would not be able to accomplish much. 

What we decide usually comes down to what is most important to us; that is, what we *value* most. 

It is said that your life is made up of a series of decisions. Another way of saying it might be that your life is made up of what you said *Yes* or *No* to.

It seems to me that Yahweh caused it to be like this to test us.

Will we put Him first in our lives? Will we spend our time building His Kingdom, or just our own?

We are all given many decisions to make? How will we choose? What will we say *Yes* to? What will we say *No* to?
