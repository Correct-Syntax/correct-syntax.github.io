### "What does it mean?"

Personally, I have an innate cautiousness about using words that I don't have a good idea what they mean. I've also always been one to be curious about the meanings behind words.

One word in particular I've always wondered about is "sucks," specifically when used in the phrase, "that sucks."

Perhaps this is striking to some people, but even as old as I am, I've never understood what it actually meant when people would say, "That sucks."

Yes, I had my guesses, but otherwise just a suspicion that it was slang and probably wouldn't be appropriate in some settings. 

So, I never used it myself.

Whenever I heard it, I made a mental note to look it up, but I hadn't actually remembered to do so until recently.


### Looking it up

According to https://usdictionary.com/idioms/that-sucks/

> The phrase "that sucks" has its roots in American English slang from the 20th century. It's an offshoot of older slang where "suck" was used as a term of derision or insult. Later on, it evolved into a more general expression of dissatisfaction or empathy for an unfortunate situation.

Some dictionaries say it's "rude slang," while others (like this one) take a slightly different stance. Indeed, it's at least *derived* from a slang term.

It appears that there's not a clear consensus on whether or not the phrase is considered rude, but it's definitely not considered appropriate in professional or non-casual settings.

Based on the origin, the phrase does seem more rude and insulting than empathetic. So, I will continue to avoid using the phrase.


### A broader question

Now I had a much broader question. 

"Would it be correct to put slang into the same category as swearing and profanity?" 

In general, I've avoided using slang because I've noticed it communicates a less serious composure and one that might not always be fitting for a believer. However, I hadn't considered the topic of slang too deeply until now. 

I do have to ask myself if slang is *useful*, *helpful*, or *necessary* in the first place. Most importantly, is it love? 

My analysis, based on Scripture, says no and no.


### Our words are important

> Death and life are in the power of the tongue. (Proverbs 18:21a)

It's wise to think about our wording. Do we build people up through the words we use? Or do we tear people down, or even just make them confused? 

When someone uses slang, it often must be decoded by the listeners in order to understand it. Therefore, can it really be called useful or necessary?

The Biblical standard is that we let no corrupt word proceed out of our mouth, "but what is good for necessary edification, that it may impart grace to the hearers." (Ephesians 4:29) 

In essence, we should speak that which is going to build someone up and show love to them.

The American HeritageÂ® Dictionary of the English Language, 5th Edition defines slang as:

> *noun* A kind of language occurring chiefly in casual and playful speech, made up typically of coinages and figures of speech that are deliberately used in place of standard terms for added raciness, humor, irreverence, or other effect.

If the goal of our speech is edification, then to me, the definition of slang doesn't indicate that it would be appropriate for a believer to include in their speech.

### Conclusion

We are to be representatives of Yahushua, our Savior, to the world. If we are deliberately adding racy, irreverent, or rude words to our speech, are we being a good witness? I don't think so. 

Based on what I see in Scripture, I'll choose not to use slang.
