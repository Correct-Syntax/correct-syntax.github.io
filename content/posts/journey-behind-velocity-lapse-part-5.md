This is the 5th post a series of devlog style posts sharing my journey creating [Velocity Lapse](https://velocitylapse.com), a time-lapse app for Android. 

You can read the previous posts to get context up to this point: [Part 1](/posts/journey-behind-velocity-lapse-part-1/), [Part 2](/posts/journey-behind-velocity-lapse-part-2/), [Part 3](/posts/journey-behind-velocity-lapse-part-3/), and [Part 4](/posts/journey-behind-velocity-lapse-part-4/).

If you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to leave a comment below.


### Capture view redesign

In preparation for upcoming additions and fixes, I redesigned the capture view interface to better fit the necessary controls and make it easier to set and reset values.


### Towards a stable app

My top priority at this point was working toward stability.

As mentioned in the last post, the Google Play console showed that the user perceived crash rate was around 6-7% (~8% at the peak).

Of the 7-8%, the export to video crash impacted the most users. Thus, I specifically prioritized getting it resolved. 

Previously, I had tried a number of "guesses" to fix the issue without success. This time, I decided to tackle it straight on rather than make a guess and wait for feedback from users. 

I found an online real device testing cloud service with enough free minutes that I could test and debug Velocity Lapse on a Galaxy A03 core device. The Galaxy A03 core was one of the devices that crashed consistently, so I knew that would be my best chance of discovering the issue. 

It was painfully slow working with a device through the internet, but I was able to finally fix the crashing issue. 

The issue turned out to be that certain devices don't support hardware encoding and needed to be configured to use *software* encoding instead. 

Why it wouldn't automatically switch when necessary, I don't know. I also wonder why any of the MediaCodec examples I'd seen online didn't include this (clearly) vital code gymnastics?

It was actually a simple problem, but hard to know without seeing the logs produced by the app crashing in debug mode.

As a result of fixing that issue, the user perceived crash rate dropped from around 6-8% to 1.7% â€”a major improvement.


### Targeting Android 13

August 31st was the deadline to update apps to target SDK 33 (Android 13) on Google Play.

A few weeks ahead of the deadline I released an update that targeted SDK 33 and made some other changes. 

Soon after, I received a number of reports that there was an error message popping up when creating a new time lapse which made the app useless for new users. 

Frustratingly, like many issues on Android, the error only occurred on certain devices, none of which I had access to. It also didn't show in any Android emulators. Thankfully, I searched the Flurry analytics dashboard for the error code and was able to locate the full stack trace in the console.

It ended up being an issue with a race condition due to the new storage permission not being called in time and some depreciated camera methods. I quickly resolved the issues and submitted an update, but unfortunately not soon enough before there was a drop off in installs. 

I also updated to the latest Flutter SDK and migrated to Material 3 widgets since the Flutter team would depreciate Material 2 in an upcoming release. 

This confirmed in my mind how important app analytics and crash reporting can be for resolving issues.


### Multiple camera lens support

For the first half of the year, switching between the available camera lenses had been in the "top most requested features" list. 

I was happy to roll out support for switching between the available camera lenses, as a Pro feature. 

Due to Android software/hardware limitations, not every secondary lens supports manual camera controls. However, just having the option to use an ultra-wide lens for a particular time-lapse shot, for example, opens up a lot of creative possibilities.


### Targeting Android 14

Though Android 14 was still in beta at this point, I decided to update the codebase for Android 14 in anticipation of the full rollout.

Android 14 introduced a few breaking features that affected Velocity Lapse, but thankfully not that many.

I needed to wait until Flutter 3.16 to support the predictive back gesture, but I wasn't too thrilled at the changes I'd need to make anyway.

Due to the new Android 14 requirement for foreground service camera permissions, I updated to include the new foreground service declarations. I also had to submit a video to Google Play demonstrating why Velocity Lapse needs to run the camera in a foreground service. 

If you're not aware, the foreground service allows Velocity Lapse to continue capturing even with the screen shut off. This is a pretty important feature, so I'm glad that Google Play accepted.

Since everything appeared to be working well on the Android 14 emulators, I decided to just go ahead and target SDK 34. 

Unfortunately, none of my physical Android devices had the Android 14 beta. So technically It wasn't tested properly. 

I'll say that this isn't something I would do if Velocity Lapse didn't carry the "early access beta" tag. But, since it did I was okay with it.


### A few milestones

Since the last post, there were a few milestones I thought I'd share:

The YouTube channel crossed **100 subscribers** and Velocity Lapse crossed **50,000 downloads** on Google Play.


### Switching from Flurry to Embrace.io. 

I appreciate Flurry analytics and the fact that it's a free service. However, Flurry is more of an analytics service than a crash reporting and logging service. 

At least right now, for Velocity Lapse, I prioritize logs and information about crash reports over analytics. So, the fact that Flurry is limited in what it can do for crash reporting and logging caused me to look for an alternative.

I came across Embrace.io which fit precisely what I needed: accurate logging, sessions, and crash reports. 

Thankfully they had a free tier as I certainly could afford to pay for it at this point. Integration was fairly straightforward and it greatly improved my debugging experience. 

With Embrace, sessions are shown in a timeline with context and breadcrumbs to help you see when the issue happened. 

This alone was much better than Flurry, which gives only the exception, and behind a tab at that. Quite frankly, I was able to actually get enough context to solve a bunch of bugs right away.

Switching services meant I needed to update the privacy policy since Embrace collects a bit more data. 

However, I think the switch was worth it since it has since greatly helped in continuing to work towards a stable app.


### The value of Velocity Lapse

Mid November, I raised price of Velocity Lapse Pro to $11.99 USD.

I'll admit that I have a certain amount of cautiousness when it comes to pricing products. The in-app purchase for Velocity Lapse Pro hasn't been different. 

Although I've had people suggest that I should be charging more, I've (stubbornly) slowly raised the price as I personally see the value increase with the approaching of Velocity Lapse having a more complete feature set. 

Perhaps I'm making a mistake there, especially since the purchase is a one-time, lifetime upgrade. However, I'd personally choose to err on the side of charging what I believe to be fair for the value it provides.

I'm really happy that people see value in purchasing Velocity Lapse Pro. It hasn't been easy and the validation of actual buyers paying for your product is probably the best you can get.

If you're reading this and you've purchased Velocity Lapse Pro, thank you for your support.


### Improvements in v0.7.0

In the v0.7.0 release, I added better switching between internal and SD card storage for projects. 

As a nice touch and feature I'd had on the roadmap for a while, I implemented a storage indicator that showed how much space was left on the selected storage type. It doubles as the button to switch storage types. This has become one of my favorite features because it just looks and works so nicely.

To make room for the new storage switcher and indicator, I also moved the video gallery to it's own tab. Having the gallery in it's own tab was not only more fitting, but actually accessible to the thumb.

The export video encoder was now more resilient to unexpected images. It would skip any invalid images and cancel the export if certain parameters aren't correct. Much better than crashing.


### Researching and revisiting

During this time I did some research to attain the best setup for a flexible way to set the timelapse settings and a simple to understand scheduling flow.

My concept was inspired by a few of the timelapse interval timer interfaces I'd seen. 

It centers around the ability to set the mode for interval and duration. The interval could be set by adjusting the length of time to capture, final video duration, or by setting the interval directly.

Although I had originally started with a similar concept way back in the very first prototypes of Velocity Lapse a year ago, I decided to revisit the concept with more experience and user feedback to guide me this time.

For the scheduling, it seemed that I would likely need a way to keep the app awake for hours until the alarm went off. Haven't worked out the details on that yet.


### New community forum

On Nov. 19th, I setup the [community forum](https://forum.velocitylapse.com) using [Flarum](https://flarum.org/), an open-source forum platform. The next day, I officially launched the forum and promoted it on the Velocity Lapse Instagram and YouTube accounts.

Whether it becomes anything, we'll have to see.


### Fixing the export ANR

During this time, I received a number of reports of Velocity Lapse freezing and causing ANR errors at the 18 frame during export. From the various reports, I was able to pinpoint the issue as affecting Pixel devices running Android 14.

To fix the issue, I decided to do a full re-write of the video export encoder. This time I made sure to use kotlin's coroutines properly and not do any heavy processing in the UI thread. 

Much like before, taking the time to re-write and re-structure the encoder had additional benefits. The new structure enabled me to setup for supporting video effects and H.265 video for inclusion in some future update. 

The re-write fixed the ANR issue and eliminated other issues with the export. Needless to say, releasing v0.7.1 with the new export engine was quite a relief.


### Moving to Stacked Architecture

Until this point I had been using my own state managagement system based on Flutter's ``setState``. As the Flutter websites says, "You'd be surprised how far you can get with just a StatefulWidget".

Although I think the codebase was arguably  *decent* for using my own setup, it failed to fully separate UI and logic. The lack of "separation of concerns" introduced some tricky bugs and was becoming a maintenance burden, especially in the code-heavy areas of the app. 

Moving forward I knew I needed a state management solution that was consistent, tested, and proven. 

I looked into Provider, Riverpod, and Bloc â€”three of the most popular state management libraries. After reviewing documentation and examples for each, I liked the simplicity of Provider. 

Then I came across [Stacked](https://stacked.filledstacks.com/), a modern, MVVM Flutter state management system with separation of concerns and dependency injection. 

After not a little agonizing (choosing state management is no small thing) and going back and forth between Stacked, Riverpod, and Provider, I decided to go with Stacked.

At first using Stacked left me a bit nervous since it uses a CLI and code generation. 

Velocity Lapse fits in the category of a complex app, with many bottom sheets, dialogs, and views with varying levels of light to heavy logic. So, naturally certain portions of the codebase were tricky to re-implement while learning the Stacked MVVM pattern.

Thanks to the documentation, over time I grasped Stacked MVVM and what the code-generating CLI actually did. 

Once I grasped the concepts, It was basically just putting in the work to re-write the Velocity Lapse codebase with Stacked architecture. It involved many hours of a (rather boring) loop of comparing then typing, as well as copy-pasting wherever possible.

In the end, the codebase was more consistent, maintainable, and SOLID. I was also able to catch a number of bugs along the way, which resulted in more stable codebase overall.

### Why I'm sharing the journeyâ€”with mistakes

If you've made it this far in reading (5 posts!), you may have been wondering a few things about my posts about creating Velocity Lapse:

*"Why a journey?"*

The journey has to do with going from idea to launching and selling a fully functional time-lapse app for Android. It has been quite a journey in learning for me at the very least.

*"Isn't it a little embarrassing to be sharing your mistakes like this?"*"

I want to give an accurate picture of the journey and overcoming of the obstacles.

Part of the reason I'm writing this dev-log is to be an inspiration to others to show the ups and the downs, the victories and the failures, the struggle and the reality of building a complex app yourself. 

Oftentimes I see articles of people that are successful in something and they share advice and some backstory. And that's all good. However, without knowing the steps they took, the late nights they spent, the sacrifice and the toil, you may not have an accurate picture of what it took for them to get where they are. 

Perhaps through this series of posts you can see that like anything, it's step by step, failures and successes. It certainly hasn't been an easy journey, but pushing through the difficulties has resulted in at least a measure of success across different fronts. 

As it was once said, "Nothing ever comes to one, that is worth having, except as a result of hard work."

I credit any success of Velocity Lapse to our Heavenly Father's grace. To have the idea, the time, and abilities He's given me to be able to learn, experiment, and work on Velocity Lapse is a blessing.
